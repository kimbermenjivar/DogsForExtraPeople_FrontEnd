# Project #2- Full Stack Project/Dogs for Extra People-Front End
Overview
The second project I was given at General Assembly was to create a Full Stack Project. I chose to do a One to many relationship app-I needed to create a Single Page Application for the web that would allow user to keep data on their dog, breed, size, fur type.

# My user stories for this project were:

As a user I can sign up, sign in, change password and sign out of the app.
Once signed in, I can add a dog, update my dogs, delete my dogs
 I can also search for other dog.
# Project Requirements:
My app has been deployed on Github pages.
Many cohesive commits dating back to the first day of building my Full Stack.
I created this README and documented the process and technologies used
I used Query for DOM manipulation and AJAX for interacting with the provided API
Technologies Used
HTML5
CSS3
SASS
Bootstrap
JavaScript
jQuery
Ruby
Rails
I used HTML5 to build the basic structure of the app and CSS3, SASS and Bootstrap to style.
The forms were done using HTML and some bootstrap.
I can also see a message that tells me I was successful with my CRUD actions.
Javascript is used to build the logic, send AJAX calls and jQuery is used to interact with the DOM and update the view

Challenges/How things went/ Things I want to improve:

Initially I struggled with hiding and showing sign in and out ect.
It took me a while to find a way to restrict changes to only the user.
I had to redeploy several times since I kept finding small corrections example: typo in error message
In the future I would like to add an option for people to be able to upload pictures of their dogs.
